# postgresql-k8s-bundle

A repo containing Juju bundles for PostgreSQL and PGBouncer on k8s.

NB: though version numbers are detailed in the bundle.yaml, they're not used by charmhub. Charmhub only makes the most recent versions on a branch available to download, so this charm will only use the most recent release of each charm.
